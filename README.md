Welcome to EDUC/PSY 6600!

This semester should be fun. My goal is to have you be ready for further statistical training, to be ready to participate in quantitative research and to have the ability to understand more of the statistical analyses in the literature in your field.

Canvas will be used for:

* Announcements (this is how the instructor will generally contact the class)
* Turning in Hassignments

This means you'll want to check Canvas regularly to make sure you are up-to-date on any changes or reminders. 

To turn in assignments, you will be required to bring paper copies of the assignment. These are skeletons and should be filled out on the printed copry. Feedback will also be given on these paper copies and returned to you the next week (hopefully) in class.  Distance students may scan and upload their homework packets on Canvas. If you are unable to do this, please contact the instructor to make other arrangments.

I highly recommend getting familiar with the syllabus. It contains vital information for you to succeed in this course. Notably, the course schedule shows readings for the week (read them prior to that lecture), the topics of the lecture, and the homework assignments due that day. All homework assignments are due by the end of the day. This means if you are not done with the assignment by class time, you can slip it under my door by the end of the day and still get full credit.

I sincerely hope you enjoy this course and feel more appreciation for data and statistics!
