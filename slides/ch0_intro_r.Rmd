### Mac: [MacTeX][10]
- Download (5+ min) to a folder and them double click on the PKG file and follow the installation instructions. 
- You don't need to open anything after MAcTeX is finished installing.

### Windows: [MikTeX][11] 
- Pick the latest version of the **Net Installer**, not the Basic!  You need the full version 
     + 64-bit is better, if you have a 64-bit machine
     + When your **download** is complete, run the downloaded **installer**. Windows may ask you if you want to *“allow this app from an unknown publisher to make changes to your PC”*. If it does, make sure to click **Yes**!
