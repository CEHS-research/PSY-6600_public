## "I have so heavily emphasized the desirability of working with <br>**few variables and large sample sizes** <br> that some of my students have spread the rumor that my idea of  the **perfect study** is one with 10,000 cases and no variables. <br> **They go too far.** "

## “Next, I have learned and taught that the primary product of research inquiry is one or more measures of **effect size**, not p values.”

## "However, as social scientists move gradually away from reliance on single studies and obsession with null hypothesis testing, **effect size** measures will become more and more popular"

### Standard of Judgement

Distribution of possible witnesses in a trial **when the accused is innocent**, showing the probable outcomes with **a single witness**.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align='center'}

What happens not only to innocent suspects but also guilty ones when they are arrested and tried for crimes. In this case, the criminals are c**learly guilty** and face **certain** punishment if arrested.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/power_high.gif')
```

If the police bungle the investigation and arrest an innocent suspect, there is still a chance that the innocent person could go to jail. Also, since the normal distribution extends to infinity in both positive and negative directions there is a very slight chance that a guilty person could be found on the left side of the standard of judgment and be incorrectly set free.  

---

Unfortunately, justice is often not as straightforward as illustrated on the last slide. This slide shows the **more typical case** in which the real criminals are **not so clearly guilty**. Notice that the means of the two distributions are much **closer** together. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/power_low.gif')
```

As before, if bungling police officers arrest an innocent suspect there's a **small chance** that the wrong person will be convicted. However, there is now also a **significant chance** that a guilty person will be set free. This is represented by the yellow/green area under the curve on the left and is a type II error.

**Increasing sample size** is an obvious way to reduce both types of errors for either the justice system or a hypothesis test. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/power_n.gif')
```


An increase of sample size **narrows** the distribution. Why? Because the distribution represents the **average** of the entire sample instead of just a single data point
