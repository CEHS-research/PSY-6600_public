## Motivating Examples

.large[
- Dr. Filburn wishes to assess the **effectiveness** of a leadership workshop for 60 middle managers. The 60 managers are rated by their immediate supervisors on the Leadership Rating Form (LRF), .coral[before] **and** .nicegreen[after] the workshop.
]

--

.large[
- Dr. Clarke is interested in determining if workers are more concerned with job security **or** pay. He gains the cooperation of 30 individuals who work in different settings and asks each employee to rate his or her concern about .coral[salary level] **and** .nicegreen[job security], on a scale from 1 to 10.
]

--

.large[
- Dr. Gale questions whether husbands **or** wives with infertility problems feel equally anxious. She recruits 24 infertile couples and then administers the Infertility Anxiety Measure (IAM) to both the .coral[husbands] **and** the .nicegreen[wives].

## Dependent Groups

## Experimental

# Repeated-Measures: successive designs

# Let's Apply This to the Cancer Dataset 

### Testing normality in the population, based on a sample


---
# Read in the Data

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(DT)
```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)    # Loads several very helpful 'tidy' packages
library(haven)        # Read in SPSS datasets
library(furniture)    # Nice tables (by our own Tyson Barrett)

```{r, include=FALSE}

```

--
### And Clean It

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cancer_clean <- cancer_raw %>% 
  dplyr::rename_all(tolower) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(id = factor(id)) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(trt = factor(trt,

                                        "Aloe Juice"))) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(stage = factor(stage))
```


---

## The Cancer Dataset

- `id` indicates the participant number
- `totalcin` as the first measurement, a.k.a. the **pre-test**
- `totalcw6` as the last measurement, a.k.a. the **post-test**

### Example 1) Data Wrangling - Create a "DIFFERENCE" score

> One line PER PERSON...time points side-by-side on the same line

```{r}

```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cancer_new %>% 
  DT::datatable(options = list(pageLength = 5))
```


---

### Example 1) Data Wrangling - Restructure to "LONG" format

> One line PER TIME POINT per person...each person will have TWO lines

```{r}
cancer_long <- cancer_new %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = c(totalcin, totalcw6),
                      names_to = c(".value", "time"),
