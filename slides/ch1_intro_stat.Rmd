# Rounding Numbers

### Rules

.large[
- If you want to round to N decimal places, look at the digit in the $N + 1$ placeâ€¦
    - If it is LESS than 5 -> do not change the digit in the Nth place
    - If it is MORE than 5 -> increase the digit in the Nth place by 1
    - If it is EQUAL to 5 AND there are no non-zero digits to the right, -> increase the digit in the Nth place by 1 ONLY IF the Nth digit is ODD (do not change it if it is EVEN)

In all cases, the last step is to drop the digit in the $N+1$ place and other digits to the right

Round to two decimal places

- $65.3 = 65.30$
- $8/3 = 2.67$
- $0.4255 = 0.43$
- $0.4358 = 0.44$
- $0.425 = 0.42$

???
Some examples up on the board:

$$
\frac{1}{5}\sum_{i = 1}^5 x_i
$$

$$
\sum_{i = 1}^2 (x_i + y_i)
$$

$$
\sum_{i = 1}^n y_i
$$

$$
\sum_{i = 1}^2 (x_i \times y_i)
$$

# Summation Rules

.pull-left[
#### Number 1
$$
\sum (X_i + Y_i) = \sum X_i + \sum Y_i
$$
$$
\sum (X_i - Y_i) = \sum X_i - \sum Y_i
$$

#### Number 2
$$
\sum_{i=1}^n C = nC
$$


#### Number 3
$$
\sum CX_i = C \sum X_i
$$

.pull-right[
#### Number 4

$$
\sum (X_i \times Y_i) \neq \sum X_i \times \sum Y_i

Why Use `R`?

.large[
- .coral[**Free**]
- Almost always up-to-date
- Best .bluer[data visualizations]
- .nicegreen[Syntax oriented] (easy to reproduce analyses)
- Gets updated regularly

Any Issues?

- Learning curve

The pro's heavily outweight the con's *if* you are willing to use it. It can save you tons of time in the long-run.

# Functions

Generally looks like:

- `stuff(arg1, arg2)`
    - `stuff` is the function's name

    -`arg1` etc. are the pieces of information we give a function

.large[Here's an example of the "mean" function:

- Using our `df` data.frame from before

1. .coral[Get the data]

4. Get .dcoral[descriptives] using `tableF()` and `table1()` from the `furniture` package to check what is going on
]]

# Step 1: Get the data

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## Data is in .sav form (SPSS)
library(rio)
d <- rio::import("Data/Ihno_dataset.sav")
d
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(rio)
d <- rio::import("~/GoogleDrive/3 Teaching/EDUC 6600/Data/Ihno_dataset.sav")
d
```


---
# Step 2: Prep the data

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
d_clean <- d %>%
  mutate(Major = factor(Major, labels = c("Psychology", "Premed",
                                          "Biology", "Sociology",
                                          "Economics"))) %>%
  mutate(Coffee = factor(Coffee))
d_clean
```


---
# Step 3: Compute new variables/values

```{r}
d_clean <- d_clean %>%
  mutate(newVar = Mathquiz/2)
```
*Note that I removed the other variables just to show you but in reality all the variables are still there
```{r, echo=FALSE}
tibble(Mathquiz = d_clean$Mathquiz, 
           newVar = d_clean$newVar)
```


---
# Step 4: Get descriptives

.pull-left[
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(furniture)
tableF(d_clean, Major)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Step 4: Get descriptives

```{r}
library(furniture)
library(dplyr)
d_clean %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(Major) %>% 
  table1(Mathquiz, Phobia, Coffee)
