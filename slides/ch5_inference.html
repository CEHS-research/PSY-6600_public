# Cautions About Significance Tests

.large[**Statistical significance**]

- only says whether the effect observed is likely to be .nicegreen[due to chance] alone, because of random sampling
- may not be .nicegreen[practically important]

That's because *statistical* significance doesn't tell you about the .nicegreen[**magnitude of the effect**], only that there likely **is** one. 

An *effect* could be too small to be .nicegreen[**relevant**].  

And with a large enough sample size, significance can be reached even for the tiniest effect.

- EX) A drug to lower temperature is found to reproducibly lower patient temperature by 0.4 degrees Celsius, `\(p \lt 0.01\)`. But clinical benefits of temperature reduction only appear for a 1 decrease or larger. 

.large[ .center[ .dcoral[**STATISTICAL significance does NOT mean PRACTICAL significance!!!**]]]




---
# Cautions About Significance Tests

### Don't ignore lack of significance

.center[.large[.dcoral[**"Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence."**]]]

.nicegreen[.center[Having no proof of who committed a murder &lt;br&gt; does not imply that the murder was not committed. ]]

Indeed, failing to find statistical significance in results is *not* rejecting the null hypothesis. This is very different from actually accepting it. The sample size, for instance, could be too small to overcome large variability in the population.

When comparing two populations, lack of significance does NOT imply that the two samples come from the same population. They could represent two very distinct populations with similar mathematical properties.

Good statistical practice is an essential component of good scientific practice, the statement observes and such practice .bluer[“emphasizes principles of good study design and conduct, a variety of numerical and graphical summaries of data, understanding of the phenomenon under study, interpretation of results in context, complete reporting and proper logical and quantitative understanding of what data summaries mean.”]  

.coral[“The p-value was never intended to be a substitute for scientific reasoning,”] said Ron Wasserstein, ASA’s executive director. .coral[“Well-reasoned statistical arguments contain much more than the value of a single number and whether that number exceeds an arbitrary threshold. The ASA statement is intended to steer research into a ‘post p&lt;0.05 era.’”]

.nicegreen[“Over time it appears the p-value has become a gatekeeper for whether work is publishable, at least in some fields,”] said Jessica Utts, ASA president. “This apparent editorial bias leads to the **‘file-drawer effect’** in which research with statistically significant outcomes are much more likely to get published, while other work that might well be just as important scientifically is never seen in print. It also leads to practices called by such names as **‘p-hacking’** and **‘data dredging’** that emphasize the search for small p-values over other statistical and scientific reasoning.”

In light of misuses of and misconceptions concerning p-values, the statement notes that statisticians often supplement or even replace p-values with other approaches. These include methods .dcoral[“that emphasize estimation over testing, such as confidence, credibility or prediction intervals; Bayesian methods; alternative measures of evidence, such as likelihood ratios or Bayes Factors; and other approaches such as decision-theoretic modeling and false discovery rates.”]

“The contents of the ASA statement and the reasoning behind it **are not new** — statisticians and other scientists have been writing on the topic for decades,” Utts said. 


---

### APA Task Force on p-values 

The six principles, which are elaborated in the statement, are:

--

1. P-values .dcoral[**CAN**] indicate how .nicegreen[incompatible] the data are with a specified *statistical model*.

--

2. P-values .dcoral[**DO NOT**] measure the *probability* that the studied .bluer[hypothesis is true], or the probability that the data were .bluer[produced by *random* chance alone].

--

3. Scientific conclusions and business or policy decisions .dcoral[**SHOULD NOT**] be based only on whether a p-value passes a specific threshold.

--

4. Proper inference requires .dcoral[**FULL REPORTING**] and .dcoral[**TRANSPARENCY**].

--

5. A p-value or statistical significance .dcoral[**DOES NOT**] measure the .bluer[**SIZE**] of an effect or the .bluer[**IMPORTANCE**] of a result.

--

6. By itself, a p-value .dcoral[**DOES NOT**] provide a .nicegreen[good measure of evidence] regarding a model or hypothesis.

# Some ways to improve the 'Crisis of Lack of Replicability'

* Be completely transparent in reporting, including data cleaning/wrangling and statistical analysis

* Make all data *(deidentified)* open source and freely available repositories

* Reduce focus on *NEW* findings and incentives *REPLICATION* studies

* Increase statistical power, often requiring larger sample sizes, more complex study design, or more sophisicated sattistical analyses

* Reduce publication bias

   + interpret p-values correctly *(not overstate)*
   + lower the reliance on p-values and the strict .05 cut-off
   + employ pre-registrations processes

#  Tests for Normaility - Age


&gt; In our population, does .dcoral[age] follow the normal distribution?

--

The Shapiro-Wilks test: 

* `\(H_0\)`: In the population, .dcoral[age] DOES follow the normal distribution
* `\(H_1\)`: In the population, .dcoral[age] does NOT follow the normal distribution

  dplyr::pull(`age`) %&gt;%       # pull out the variable in question 
  shapiro.test()               # run the Shapiro Wilks test of normality (in base R)

	Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  .
W = 0.98317, p-value = 0.9399
```

--

Big p-value...fail to reject the Null...

--

&gt; **Conclusion:** The Shapiro-Wilks test on this sample provides **no evidence** that distribution of .dcoral[age] in the population is **not** normally distributed, *W* = 0.98, p = .940.
